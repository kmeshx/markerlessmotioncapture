% the mathematical model is based on the collinearity equations in
% Photogrammetry and machine vision topics. 
% Input: 1- orienation of the multi cameras "three angles [deg.] and three coordinates[m]"
%        2- camera calibration parameters (or EXIF data)  [height;width;psize;focal length] 
% 
% Output: 
% 3D metric coordinates of the image points by least square adjustment
